# Remove emoji from CKEDITOR
This is a simple plugin that will remove emoji characters when content is saved.

Emojis can be fun but are not always appropriate or feasable to support due to database restrictions. Originally created for use in Drupal on a system with a version of MYSQL that does not suport utftmb4.
